A scientific simulation tool that models the bioethanol fermentation process, helping researchers and students understand the relationship between input parameters and ethanol production.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Adjust fermentation parameters and see real-time results
- **Visual Analytics**: Clear graphs showing biomass growth, substrate consumption, and ethanol production
- **Cost Analysis**: Estimates production costs per gram of ethanol
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Based on established biochemical models (Monod equation, Luedeking-Piret model)

## ðŸ§ª How It Works

The simulator calculates ethanol production through 10 key biochemical steps:

1. Calculates microorganism growth rate based on impeller speed
2. Determines substrate consumption using Monod kinetics
3. Models ethanol production with Luedeking-Piret equations
4. Computes final product concentration and total yield
5. Estimates production costs
